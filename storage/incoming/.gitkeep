# Incoming Media Storage

This directory stores media files immediately after download, before any processing.

## Workflow

1. Downloader completes → file moved here
2. Media analysis runs on files in this directory
3. After analysis → files moved to `../working/`

## Cleanup

Files are automatically moved out after analysis.
Stale files (>24h) should be investigated for failed jobs.
